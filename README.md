This repository tracks experiments with the [google-ai-edge/gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery) project.

## Fork and clone

Use the GitHub CLI to create a fork and clone it locally:

```bash
gh repo fork google-ai-edge/gallery --clone

The fork is checked out in the `gallery/` directory.

## Ignoring non-text files

Binary assets and the entire `gallery/` directory are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` so only text files are tracked.
